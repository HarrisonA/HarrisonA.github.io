title: Danger Variables
---
A very simple, yet useful trick.

Whenever you are writing a recursive function, you run the risk of 
the recursion never ending and causing a stack overflow.
<br><br>
One way to prevent this is to create a "danger" variable.  Essentially, 
the danger variable is a way to provide an exit from function that is running in infinite recursion.
<br>
How it works: 
<br><br>1) Create a global danger variable and set it equal to zero
<br><br>2) Every time you enter the recursive function, increase the count of that variable and check if that count is greater than the amount recursive calls you expect
<br>
<br>
3) If the danger count ever exceeds that number, exit the recursive function
<br>
{% highlight javascript %}

var function = someFunction(){
  var danger = 0;
  
  var function = recursiveFunc (){
    danger++;
    if (danger > 200) return;

    // write the body of the recursive function here
    
  } 

}
{% endhighlight %}
