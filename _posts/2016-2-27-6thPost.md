title: Danger Variables
---
A very simple, yet useful trick.

Whenever you are writing a recursive function, you run into the risk of 
the recursion never ending and causing a stack overflow.
<br>
One way to prevent this is to create a "danger" variable.  Essentially, 
the danger variable is a way to exit a function in the case that it 
might never end. 

How it works: 
1) Create a global danger variable and set it equal to zero
2) Increase the count of that variable every time you enter the recursive function and check that count vs some number that is somewhat larger
than the number of recursive calls you expect Example: danger < 200
3) If the count ever goes higher than 200, then exit the function
<br>

{% highlight javascript %}

var function = someFunction(){
  var danger = 0;
  
  var function = recursiveFunc (){
    danger++;
    if (danger > 200) return;

    // create a recursive base case
    // add some logic that calls recusiveFunc
    
  } 

}
{% endhighlight %}
