A good friend suggests an idea for an app. You decide to build an app based on that idea. Is that idea worth anything?
<br>
<br>
<i>I informally surveyed a few software engineers and got a few answers:</i>
<br>
<ol>
<li>"No!"</li>
<li>"If they only give the idea, then they are only entitled to a published credit."</li>
<li>"No money, but maybe a nice dinner and a bottle of wine."</li>
<li>"If I make millions off the app, I'll give them a very small percentage or a one-time payment."</li>
<li>"If they helped me build it, then they're entitled to compensation, otherwise they'll just get listed as the contributor of the idea."</li>
<li>"If no agreement is made in advance, they are not entitled to anything."</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h1>What's your thoughts?</h1>
