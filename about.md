I love solving real world problems and puzzles with software. I take great pride in creating things that makes the lives of others easier and more enjoyable.  Have you ever had a parking ticket? Of course you have. I worked on the design and creation of a parking app called “Spotz”.  Spotz is awesome and will help you avoid future parking tickets.

Spotz is a web based MyEAN stack desktop and mobile app that displays available parking options (on a map) according to date, time and location. With this app, users can locate places to park and avoid parking tickets. Spotz was designed on the frontend with AngularJS, and on the backend with Node/Express and MySql.
