I take great pride in creating things that makes the lives of others easier and more enjoyable. One of my passions is building apps that solve real world problems, like getting parking tickets. I enjoy working with full stack technologies including Javascript, AngularJS, Node, Express, MySQL and MongoDB. Check out my parking app [Spotz](http://spotz.herokuapp.com) it can help you avoid future parking tickets.

I've lived abroad in Panama and Brazil, where I picked up conversational Spanish and Portuguese. I enjoy DJing and have performed at public and private events. My passions include teaching Capoeira and practicing other forms of movement (yoga, body weight exercises, weight lifting)._
